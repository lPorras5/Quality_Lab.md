### Modern WarFare 2

A classic call of duty game that I would say most people have played. From campaign to multiplayer there were many awesome moments that gave the game the recognition it deserved. With the many features in the multiplayer from the level up system, the gameplay, the variety of weapons and grenades and the chatroom that many players had used for its significance of talking to other players being either friendly or toxic but it was funny most of the time.

### Assassins Creed 3

This is the first game out of teh series that I've ever player
