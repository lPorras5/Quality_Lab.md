### Modern WarFare 2

A classic call of duty game that I would say most people have played. From campaign to multiplayer there were many awesome moments that gave the game the recognition it deserved. With the many features in the multiplayer from the level up system, the gameplay, the variety of weapons and grenades and the chatroom that many players had used for its significance of talking to other players being either friendly or toxic but it was funny most of the time.

### Assassins Creed 3

This is the first game out of the series that I've ever played and beat. To be honest this game was a great introduction for me in the franchise. You play as a character that pretty much has an out of body experience where he set back into time of around the 1800s of the U.S and was born and later raised up to be an assassin. I loved a lot of the gameplay from the fighting to jumping off a tall building and landing in a hay stack with no damage taken at all.

### Grand Theft Auto 5

At the time this game was very popular and somewhat still is as of right now. GTA a series everyone knows and love from the many cars to customize and drive and the weapons that makes the game enjoyable. While being one of the first to have a multiplayer with many gamemodes attached and to be successful for the longest time. Adding heist missions to their multiplayer game allowed people or friends to get together and do some big heists to make big money for the accomplishments of being rich and being able to buy what the game supplies.
